<h1><b>TensorFlow.js</b></h2>

<p>TensorFlow.js, an open-source library you can use to define, train, and run machine learning models entirely in the browser, using JavaScript and a high-level layers API. If you’re a JavaScript developer who’s new to ML, TensorFlow.js is a great way to begin learning.
</p>
<h1><b>TensorFlow Lite</b></h2>
<p>TensorFlow Lite is a set of tools to help developers run TensorFlow models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices. It enables on-device machine learning inference with low latency and small binary size. This led to pre-trained deep learning models designed for mobile devices. There are many pre-trained models made for TensorFlow.js. We will be using MobileNet for Image Classification.
MobileNet</P>
<h1><b>MobileNet</b></h2
<p>MobileNets are small, low-latency, low-power models parameterized to meet the resource constraints of a variety of use cases. They can be built upon for classification, detection, embedding and segmentation.
